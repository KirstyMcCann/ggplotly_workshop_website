# How to participate in this workshop?

## 1. Google Collabs

The tutorial is able to run the code as we walk through each step, you can edit and change the code as it suits you.

The ggplotly() interactive features do not work in Google Collabs. To see the difference the code will be run and the output will be compared within this presentation.

### Why use Google Collabs?

-   **No installation needed** – runs entirely in the browser.

-   **Free to use** – provides CPU, GPU, and TPU resources at no cost.

-   **Easy access** – just share a link; participants can start coding immediately.

-   **Cloud storage** – notebooks and files can be saved in Google Drive.

-   **Collaboration ready** – multiple people can edit or comment, like Google Docs.

-   **Supports many languages** – Python, R, Julia, and more with setup.

-   **Reproducible** – same environment for all participants.

-   **GitHub integration** – open notebooks directly from repositories.

-   **Interactive outputs** – supports plots, widgets, and even apps.

-   **Great for teaching** – consistent interface, easy to reset/refresh.
