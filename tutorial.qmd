# Introduction

This workshop introduces **ggplotly**, which bridges `ggplot2` and `plotly` to create interactive graphics in R.

You will learn how to:

-   Start with basic plots using `ggplot2`

-   Add interactivity with `ggplotly`

-   Explore case studies (health data, COVID‑19, malaria genomics)

-   Save and share interactive plots

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setup

Install required packages if not already installed:

```{r install_packages, eval=FALSE}

# Option 1: Install at the same time
#install.packages(c("plotly", "ggplot2", "readr", "dplyr", "lubridate", "gganimate", "ape", "ggtree", "circlize", "RColorBrewer", "gplots", "reshape2"))

# Option 2: Install seperately
#install.packages("plotly")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("readr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("lubridate")
#install.packages("gganimate")
#install.packages("ape")
#install.packages("ggtree")
#install.packages("reshape2")
```

Load libraries:

```{r load_package}

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(gganimate)
library(ape)
library(ggtree)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(gplots)
library(reshape2)
library(gridGraphics)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Warm‑up Example: mtcars

Let’s begin with the built‑in dataset `mtcars`.

When we create a scatter plot with **ggplot2** using the `mtcars` dataset, we get a static figure. By wrapping the same plot in **`ggplotly()`**, it becomes interactive.

The interactive version lets you explore the data more dynamically: you can click legend items to hide or show categories, hover over points to see their exact values, and zoom or pan within the plot for a closer look.

```{r mtcars}

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Weight", color = "Cylinders")

# Static
p

# Interactive
ggplotly(p)

```

✅ Try hovering over points, clicking legend items, and zooming in!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Case Study 1: Health Data

**Research Question**: How does age and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, exercise) influence blood pressure across regions?

```{r load_df}

df <- read.csv("data/simulated_health_data_with_biomarkers.csv")
```

## Scatterplots

```{r scatterplot}

p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Age vs Blood Pressure")

ggplotly(p1)
```

-   **Purpose:** Shows the relationship between two continuous variables (e.g., *age* vs *blood pressure*).

-   **Why:** Helps us see general patterns (e.g., older individuals may have higher blood pressure).

Add smoking:

```{r smoking}

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = blood_pressure, color = smoker)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Blood Pressure by Age and Smoking")

ggplotly(p2)

```

## 

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Add **color = smoker** to see if smoking status influences the age–blood pressure relationship.

-   Try changing the shape by **exercise_level**.
:::

```{r scatter-solution, code-fold: true}

p1_sol <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = blood_pressure, color = smoker, shape = exercise_level, text = paste("Sample:", subject_id, "<br>Region:", region, "<br>Exercise:", exercise_level))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + labs(title = "Age vs Blood Pressure by Smoking & Exercise")

ggplotly(p1_sol, tooltip = "text")

```

## Multivariate Plot

```{r multivariate}

p3 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = blood_pressure, color = smoker, shape = exercise_level, text = label)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Interactive Scatter: Age, BP, Smoking, Exercise")

ggplotly(p3, tooltip = "text")

```

-   **Purpose:** Adds more variables (smoking status, exercise level) using color, shape, or tooltip labels.
-   **Why:** Real-world health outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, so we want to see how lifestyle intersects with age and blood pressure.

## Box & Violin Plots

```{r box}

p4 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = exercise_level, y = blood_pressure, fill = exercise_level)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Blood Pressure by Exercise Level")

ggplotly(p4)

```

```{r violin}

p_violin <- ggplot(df, aes(x = smoker, y = blood_pressure, fill = smoker)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white", outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Blood Pressure by Smoking Status")

ggplotly(p_violin)
```

-   **Purpose:** Summarise the distribution of blood pressure across groups (e.g., smoker vs non-smoker, different exercise levels).
-   **Why:** Helps compare variability, medians, and outliers between groups. Violin plots additionally show the *distribution shape*.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Change this to a **violin plot** (`geom_violin`) to see the distribution of blood pressure within each exercise group.

-   Add jittered points with `geom_jitter()` to see individual values.
:::

## Faceting by Region

```{r facet}

p5 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = blood_pressure, color = smoker, text = label)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~region) +
  labs(title = "Blood Pressure by Region")

ggplotly(p5, tooltip = "text")

```

-   **Purpose:** Splits the dataset into subplots (e.g., by *region*).
-   **Why:** Allows comparison across categories without overloading a single plot. For example, we can ask: *Is the age–blood pressure relationship consistent across rural, suburban, and urban regions?*

## Correlation Heatmap

```{r heatmap}

corr_data <- df %>% select(age, blood_pressure, bmi, cholesterol)
corr_mat <- round(cor(corr_data, use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 2)
melted <- melt(corr_mat)

p_corr <- ggplot(melted, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = value)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap")

ggplotly(p_corr)


```

-   **Purpose:** Display pairwise correlations between multiple numeric health indicators (age, blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol).

-   **Why:** Provides a quick overview of which factors are most strongly related.

## Summary of Findings (Case Study 1)

-   Blood pressure tends to increase with age.

-   Smokers may have higher blood pressure compared to non-smokers.

-   Exercise level appears to influence blood pressure distribution (lower in higher exercise groups).

-   Correlation analysis highlights potential links between health indicators (e.g., BMI and blood pressure).

-   Regional differences emerge when using facets, suggesting environment also matters.

## Why Use `ggplotly` for Interactivity?

**Enhanced Exploration**

-   Hovering shows exact values (age, BP, lifestyle factors).

-   Tool tips allow inclusion of metadata (subject ID, labels).

**Data Filtering**

-   Legends are clickable — users can hide/show smokers, exercise levels, or regions.

**Zoom & Pan**

-   Users can focus on sub-ranges (e.g., ages 20–40 or BP \> 160).

**Communication**

-   Interactive plots are more engaging for teaching, reporting, or sharing with non-technical audiences.

## Advantages of these Analyses

-   Capture both overall patterns and group-specific differences.

-   Combine exploratory (scatter, violin) and summary (boxplot, heatmap) approaches.

-   Facilitate hypothesis generation — e.g., does exercise buffer age-related blood pressure increases?

::: callout-note
## Reflection

-   Which lifestyle factor (smoking, exercise, BMI, cholesterol) showed the strongest relationship with blood pressure?

-   Did faceting by region or age group reveal any new patterns?

-   Write down 2–3 sentences summarising your findings.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Case Study 2: COVID-19

**Research Question**: How did COVID‑19 strains spread over geography and time?

```{r load_covid}
# Load the dataset
df <- read.csv("data/simulated_covid_strains.csv")
rownames(df) <- df$sample_id

glimpse(df)
summary(df)
table(df$strain)
```

## Geographic Spread

```{r strain_summary}

strain_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(country, strain) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), latitude = mean(latitude), longitude = mean(longitude), .groups = "drop")

plot_geo(strain_summary) %>%
  add_markers(x = ~longitude, y = ~latitude, size = ~count, color = ~strain,
              text = ~paste("Country:", country, "<br>Strain:", strain, "<br>Count:", count),
              hoverinfo = "text") %>%
  layout(title = "COVID‑19 Strain Frequency by Country",
         geo = list(scope = "world", projection = list(type = "natural earth")))

```

-   **Purpose**: Visualise where strains occur and how frequently in each country.

-   **Why**: Shows global spread and geographic hotspots of different strains.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Change `scope = "world"` to `"asia"` or `"europe"` to zoom in on specific regions.

-   Try coloring by **country** instead of strain.
:::

## 

## Time Trends

```{r trends}

df <- df %>% mutate(month = floor_date(as.Date(collection_date), "month"))

strain_trend <- df %>% group_by(month, strain) %>% summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

timeline <- ggplot(strain_trend, aes(x = month, y = count, color = strain)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Strain Evolution Over Time")

ggplotly(timeline)

```

-   **Purpose**: Track strain counts over time.

-   **Why**: Lets us see how specific variants emerge, rise, and decline.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Change the x-axis to `year` only (aggregate with `lubridate::year()`).

-   Add `facet_wrap(~country)` to compare strain dynamics between countries.
:::

```{r timeline_sol, code-fold: true}

strain_trend_year <- df %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(month)) %>%
  group_by(year, strain, country) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

timeline_sol <- ggplot(strain_trend_year, aes(x = year, y = count, color = strain)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  labs(title = "Strain Evolution Over Years by Country")

ggplotly(timeline_sol)
```

## Relative Proportions

```{r proportions}

strain_trend_prop <- df %>%
  group_by(month) %>% mutate(total = n()) %>%
  group_by(month, strain) %>% summarise(prop = n()/unique(total), .groups="drop")

p_area <- ggplot(strain_trend_prop, aes(x = month, y = prop, fill = strain)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Relative Frequency of Strains Over Time")

ggplotly(p_area)
```

-   **Purpose**: Show the proportion of each strain at different time points.
-   **Why**: Easier to see when one strain becomes dominant over others, even if total case numbers vary.

## Phylogenetic Tree

```{r tree}

mut_matrix <- dist(df$mutations)
tree <- nj(mut_matrix)
tree$tip.label <- df$sample_id

strain_colors <- scales::hue_pal()(length(unique(df$strain)))

ggtree(tree, layout = "circular", aes(color = strain)) %<+% df +
  geom_tree(color = "gray70") +
  geom_tippoint(size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = strain_colors)
```

-   **Purpose**: Display genetic relationships between samples.
-   **Why**: Reveals how strains are related, showing clusters, divergence, and evolutionary history.

## Summary of Findings (Case Study 2)

-   Different strains are distributed unevenly across the globe.

-   Some strains rise quickly over time while others decline.

-   Dominance shifts are clear when looking at relative proportions (e.g., one variant replaces another).

-   Phylogenetic analysis confirms these dynamics, showing how strains diverge from common ancestors.

## Why Use `ggplotly` for Interactivity?

-   **Maps**: Hover to see country, strain, and sample count; zoom to specific regions.

-   **Timelines**: Hover reveals exact counts per strain per month.

-   **Stacked Areas**: Clicking legend items lets you isolate or compare particular strains.

-   **Trees**: Tool tips can add sample IDs, making phylogenetics more interpretable.

## Advantages of These Analyses

-   Integrates epidemiology (spread in space and time) with genomics (strain evolution).

-   Makes it easier to communicate *both patterns* (e.g., global dominance of one strain) and *details* (e.g., a country-specific outbreak).

-   Interactivity allows policymakers, scientists, and the public to explore the data themselves.

-   Helps answer complex questions: *Where did new strains appear first? How quickly did they spread? How are they genetically related?*

::: callout-note
## Reflection

-   Which strains spread most rapidly across regions?

-   Did the timeline show any waves of infection linked to specific variants?

-   Summarise the key insight from the interactive plots in 2–3 sentences.

# Case Study 3: Malaria Genomics

**Research Question**: How can we identify and visualize the spread of drug resistance in malaria parasite populations?

```{r load_malaria}

genome_data <- read.csv("data/simulated_malaria_genome_data_with_fst.csv")
#shared_segments <- read.csv("data/simulated_malaria_shared_gene_links.csv")
ld_matrix <- as.matrix(read.csv("data/simulated_malaria_ld_matrix_chr1.csv", row.names = 1))

malaria <- read.csv("data/simulated_malaria_drugresistance.csv")

# Ensure gene_id is row names of LD matrix
rownames(ld_matrix) <- colnames(ld_matrix)

```

## PCA/DAPC

```{r DAPC}

p1 <- ggplot(malaria, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=resistance,
                          text=paste("Sample:", sample_id,
                                     "<br>Region:", region,
                                     "<br>Year:", year))) +
  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="Population Structure of Malaria Parasites",
       x="PC1", y="PC2")

ggplotly(p1, tooltip="text")

```

-   **Purpose**: Show overall genetic structure of parasite populations.

-   **Why**: Helps detect clustering of resistant vs. sensitive parasites and highlights whether resistance is spreading within or across regions.

-   Interactivity adds hover labels (sample, region, year) so you can connect points to metadata.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Recolor this PCA by **region** instead of resistance.

-   Add `facet_wrap(~year)` to compare across years.
:::

## 

## Distribution of FST

```{r fst}

p_fst <- ggplot(genome_data, aes(x = fst)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of FST Across Genes")

ggplotly(p_fst)
```

-   **Purpose**: Quantify genetic differences between parasite populations (e.g., across regions or years).

-   **Why**: Helps identify regions of the genome under selection or where populations are diverging.

## Manhattan Plot

```{r manhattan}

p_manhattan <- ggplot(genome_data, aes(x = start, y = fst, color = species, text = gene_id)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~chr, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "FST Across Chromosomes")

ggplotly(p_manhattan, tooltip = "text")
```

## GWAS

```{r GWAS}

p2 <- ggplot(malaria, aes(x=snp_pos, y=-log10(pval),
                          color=factor(snp_chr),
                          text=paste("Chr:", snp_chr,
                                     "<br>Pos:", snp_pos,
                                     "<br>P:", signif(pval,3)))) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title="GWAS Manhattan Plot for Drug Resistance",
       x="Genomic Position", y="-log10(p-value)") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p2, tooltip="text")
```

-   **Purpose**: Identify SNPs associated with drug resistance.
-   **Why**: Allows quick spotting of genomic “peaks” (e.g., on chromosome 7) that may correspond to known drug resistance genes (*pfcrt*, *pfmdr1*).
-   Interactivity lets you zoom in, filter chromosomes, and hover to see SNP details.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Zoom into chromosome 7 to see the strong association peak.

-   Add `facet_wrap(~region)` to compare signals between regions.
:::

```{r p2_sol, code-fold: true}
p2_sol <- ggplot(malaria %>% filter(snp_chr == 7),
                 aes(x = snp_pos, y = -log10(pval),
                     color = region,
                     text = paste("SNP:", snp_chr,
                                  "<br>Pos:", snp_pos,
                                  "<br>P:", signif(pval, 3)))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "GWAS Results: Chromosome 7, by Region")

ggplotly(p2_sol, tooltip = "text")
```

## Drug resistance Prediction Plot

```{r Prediction}

p3 <- ggplot(malaria, aes(x=freq, y=resistant_binary,
                          color=resistance,
                          text=paste("Sample:", sample_id,
                                     "<br>Allele Freq:", round(freq,2),
                                     "<br>Status:", resistance))) +
  geom_jitter(height=0.05, alpha=0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"),
              se=FALSE, color="black") +
  labs(title="Predicted Probability of Resistance",
       x="Allele Frequency", y="Resistance (0/1)")

ggplotly(p3, tooltip="text")
```

-   **Purpose**: Visualize the probability of resistance given allele frequency.

-   **Why**: Shows how certain mutations strongly predict drug resistance status.

-   Interactivity lets you hover over points to see which individuals drive the relationship.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Add hover text to show `sample_id`.
:::

## 

## Drug resistance Spread over time

```{r res_trend}

res_trend <- malaria %>%
  group_by(year, region) %>%
  summarise(resistant_rate = mean(resistant_binary),
            n=n(), .groups="drop")

p4 <- ggplot(res_trend, aes(x=year, y=resistant_rate,
                            color=region,
                            text=paste("Region:", region,
                                       "<br>Year:", year,
                                       "<br>Resistant Rate:", round(resistant_rate,2),
                                       "<br>n:", n))) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  labs(title="Spread of Resistance Over Time",
       x="Year", y="Resistance Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p4, tooltip="text")

```

-   Purpose: Track how resistance frequency changes across regions and years.

-   Why: Reveals whether resistance is spreading in particular areas (e.g., rapid increase in SE Asia after 2015).

-   Interactivity makes it easy to hover for exact rates, zoom into certain years, and compare regions.

::: callout-tip
## Exercise

-   Restrict the time window to `year >= 2010`.

-   Try faceting by `region` for clearer comparison.
:::

```{r res-trend-solution, code-fold: true}
# Filter to a recent time window (example: from 2010 onward)
res_trend_recent <- malaria %>%
  filter(year >= 2010) %>%
  group_by(year, region) %>%
  summarise(resistant_rate = mean(resistant_binary),
            n = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Faceted plot by region
p4_sol <- ggplot(res_trend_recent, aes(x = year, y = resistant_rate,
                                       color = region,
                                       text = paste("Region:", region,
                                                    "<br>Year:", year,
                                                    "<br>Resistant Rate:", round(resistant_rate, 2),
                                                    "<br>n:", n))) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~region) +
  labs(title = "Spread of Resistance Over Time (since 2010)",
       x = "Year", y = "Resistance Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p4_sol, tooltip = "text")

```

## Summary of Findings (Case Study 3)

-   **Population structure (PCA)**: Resistant parasites cluster more strongly in SE Asia, suggesting a regional origin of resistance.

-   FST highlights loci where populations are genetically diverging — potentially due to selection (e.g., drug resistance).

-   **GWAS Manhattan plot**: Strong association signals on chromosome 7, consistent with known drug resistance genes.

-   **Prediction plot**: Resistance probability increases sharply with allele frequency at key SNPs.

-   **Dynamics plot**: Resistance frequency is rising over time, especially in SE Asia post-2015, with slower spread elsewhere.

## Why Use `ggplotly` for Interactivity?

-   Hovering makes it easy to link individuals (in PCA) or SNPs (in GWAS) to metadata.

-   **FST Plots**: Zoom in to regions of high differentiation for closer inspection.

-   Zooming in helps focus on specific genomic regions or time windows.

-   Legends let you toggle regions, resistance status, or chromosomes on and off.

-   For teaching and exploration, interactivity makes complex genomics data more approachable.

## Advantages of These Analyses

-   Combines population genetics, evolutionary biology, and visualisation in one workflow.

-   Helps researchers detect signals of drug resistance, adaptation, and epidemiological shifts.

-   Interactivity lowers barriers for exploring high-dimensional genomic data.

-   Useful for both hypothesis generation (*which genes might be under selection?*) and communication (*showing resistance hotspots to policymakers*).

-   Detects drug resistance origins and spread across time and geography.

-   Links genotype to phenotype in an intuitive, visual way.

<!-- -->

-   Interactivity empowers both scientists and policymakers to explore the data dynamically.

::: callout-note
## Reflection

-   Where did drug resistance appear to spread first?

-   Which SNPs were most strongly associated with resistance?

-   Summarise the population genomic findings in 2–3 sentences.
